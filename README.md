# Cisco-Proposal-Ka-Fe

Our goal is to develop a network for a coffee company that securely and efficiently connects the distribution center to the stores, corporate building, and offices, and allows employees to have control over these facilities. This network also has to cover all communication needs according to our parameters, for example: number of employees, diversity of internal departments, Internet network for guests, wired and wireless connection needs, etc.

Today, we are looking to expand to several points of sale. The main corporate building is located in Monterrey, with a total of 70 employees and a branch office with 10 employees. The corporate office acts as a hub for servers and services, and there are multiple offices, points of sale and distribution centers in different parts of the country. Branch offices are located in 3 other cities and have an average of 10 employees in each. In another city, our distribution center is located, with 20 employees working there. This adds up to a total of 130 employees in 5 different locations.

The whole company will be distributed in Monterrey, Mexico City, Puebla, Guadalajara, and Ciudad Ju√°rez
